  # Fix RLS Infinite Recursion Error

  1. Problem
    - The existing RLS policies on user_profiles table cause infinite recursion
    - Admin policy tries to check user role by querying user_profiles table within the policy itself
    - This creates a circular dependency

  2. Solution
    - Drop existing problematic policies
    - Create simple, non-recursive policies
    - Use auth.uid() directly for user access
    - Create a separate admin check that doesn't cause recursion

  3. Security
    - Users can only access their own profile data
    - Simple role-based access without circular dependencies
